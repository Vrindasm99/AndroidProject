                        "Key Concepts:\n" +
                        "• Specific Columns: You can list the exact column names you want (e.g., Name, City) to make your query faster.\n" +
                        "• Wildcard (*): Using the asterisk symbol (*) selects EVERY column in the table. This is useful for browsing data but can be slower on large tables.\n" +
                        "• Case Sensitivity: SQL keywords (like SELECT, FROM) are not case sensitive, but it is a professional standard to write them in UPPERCASE.",

                        "Syntax Rules:\n" +
                        "• Text values must be enclosed in single quotes (e.g., 'Mexico').\n" +
                        "• Numeric values should NOT be in quotes (e.g., 500).\n\n" +
